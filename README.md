### CubaseKeyCommands.html, CubaseGenericRemote.html

Single Page HTML apps that convert the Cubase XML Format of the Keycommands preference file or an exported Generic Remote file to a pretty HTML display that can be printed or saved.

Do it online [here](https://janminor.github.io/cubase/index.html)

Or Download the zip file (https://github.com/janminor/cubase/archive/master.zip) to your computer, unzip and open the resulting folder to have it locally availabe.

You will need an xml file from Cubase as input.

For KeyCommands, the "Key Commands.xml" on Windows is in "%APPDATA%\Steinberg\Cubase 10.5_64"(or the respective version, e.g. "9.5_64").
On a Mac, look in “/Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/[program name]/”.

For the generic Remote, you first need to export the config you want from the "Generic Remote" Dialog in Cubase.

Then just double-click in the HTML-File (CubaseKeyCommands.html or CubaseGenericRemote.html), open the XML File and go.
